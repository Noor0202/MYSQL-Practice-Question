25. **Customer Segment Analysis:**
   Write a query to categorize customers into segments based on their total rental amount. Use the `CASE` statement to assign customers to segments such as "High Value," "Medium Value," and "Low Value" based on their rental spending.

->  select pay.customer_id, cust.name as Customer_Name,sum(pay.amount) as Total_Amount,
    case when sum(pay.amount) < 100 then "Low Value"
         when ((sum(pay.amount) >= 100) and (sum(pay.amount) < 150)) then "Medium Value"
         else "High Value"
    end as Segment
    from payment pay inner join customer_list cust on pay.customer_id = cust.ID
    group by pay.customer_id
    order by
    	case when Segment = 'Low Value' then 1
    	     when Segment = 'Medium Value' then 2
    	     else 3
    	end;

26. **Film Inventory Status:**
   Develop a query to determine the status of film inventory based on the number of available copies. Use the `CASE` statement to categorize films as "Available," "Low Stock," or "Out of Stock" based on the quantity of available copies in the inventory.

->  select film_id, total_count_in_inventory, available_count,
    case when available_count > 0 then 'Available'
         when (available_count > 0 and available_count < 3) then 'Low Stock'
         else 'Out of Stock'
    end as inventory_status
    from (select inventory.film_id, count(distinct inventory.inventory_id) as total_count_in_inventory, (count(distinct inventory.inventory_id) - count(distinct rental.inventory_id)) as available_count
          from inventory left join rental on inventory.inventory_id = rental.inventory_id
    group by inventory.film_id) as availability_summary;

27. **Late Return Penalty Calculation:**
   Create a query to calculate the late return penalty for each rental transaction. Use the `CASE` statement to determine if a rental is overdue and calculate the penalty based on the number of days overdue.
->	select rental_id, rental_date, return_date,
	case when return_date is null then 'rental not returned yet'
	     when return_date > rental_date + interval 3 day then concat('late by ', datediff(return_date, rental_date + interval 3 day), ' days. penalty: $', datediff(return_date, rental_date + interval 3 day) * late_fee)
	     else 'no late return penalty'
	end as penalty
	from rental
	limit 50;

28. **Customer Renting Behavior Analysis:**
   Write a query to analyze the renting behavior of customers based on the genres of films they rent. Use the `CASE` statement to categorize customers into segments such as "Action Lovers," "Romantic Enthusiasts," "Comedy Fans," etc., based on the genres of films they rent most frequently.

->  SELECT Customer_ID, Customer_Name,
    CASE WHEN Family_count >= Adventure_count AND Family_count >= Other_count THEN 'Family-oriented customers'
         WHEN Adventure_count >= Family_count AND Adventure_count >= Other_count THEN 'Adventure seekers and enthusiasts'
         ELSE 'Intellectual and culturally inclined customers'
    END AS Genre_Segments
    FROM (SELECT r.customer_id AS Customer_ID, cl.name AS Customer_Name,
          SUM(CASE WHEN fc.category_id IN (2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8) THEN 1
                   ELSE 0

			INNER JOIN film_category fc ON i.film_id = fc.film_id
			INNER JOIN customer_list cl ON r.customer_id = cl.ID
    GROUP BY Customer_ID, Customer_Name) AS genre_counts
    ORDER BY Customer_ID;

29. **Film Rental Trends:**
   Develop a query to identify the trend of film rentals over time. Use the `CASE` statement to categorize rentals into time periods (e.g., "Morning," "Afternoon," "Evening," "Night") and analyze the distribution of rentals throughout the day.

->  	select f.film_id, r.customer_id, r.rental_date,
	case when time(r.rental_date) >= '05:00:00' and time(r.rental_date) < '12:00:00' then 'Morning'
	     when time(r.rental_date) >= '12:00:00' and time(r.rental_date) < '16:00:00' then 'Afternoon'
	     when time(r.rental_date) >= '16:00:00' and time(r.rental_date) < '21:00:00' then 'Evening'
	     else 'Night'
	end as Time_Schedule
	from rental r inner join inventory i on r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id
		      inner join film f on i.film_id = f.film_id;

30. **Customer Loyalty Program Eligibility:**
   Create a query to determine the eligibility of customers for a loyalty program based on their rental history. Use the `CASE` statement to evaluate criteria such as the number of rentals, total spending, and frequency of rentals to determine eligibility.

->  	select p.customer_id, count(p.customer_id) as frequency, sum(p.amount) as total_spending,
	case when sum(p.amount) > 150 and count(p.customer_id) > 30 then 'Loyal Customer'
	     else 'No Loyal'
	end as loyalty_test
	from rental r inner join payment p on r.rental_id = p.rental_id
	group by p.customer_id
	order by
		case when loyalty_test = 'Loyal Customer' then 1
		     else 2
		end;
